# random_quote_service_python
 This is the python version of the quotes service. 

 Basic webserver is using flask due to the simplicty of this project.
 The FileClient uses the csv package from the python standard library.
 Also included is a requirements.txt file and a pipfile. I utilized pipenv for a virtual environment.
